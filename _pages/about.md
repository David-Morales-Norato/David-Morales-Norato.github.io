I am a Master Student in Applied Mathematics working in the High Dimensional Signal Processing (HDSP) research group, jointly supervised by Professors [Henry Arguello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R7gjbGIAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Hoover Rueda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=seyRms4AAAAJ&hl=es). My research focuses in optics and algorithm design for privacy preserving aware computer vision methods. Before starting my masters, I received my B.S. in Systems Engineer from Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS) in 2022 supervised by [Andr√©s Jerez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YCBEzFoAAAAJ&hl=es) and [Henry Arguello](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=R7gjbGIAAAAJ&hl=es) developing in phase retrieval algorithms.
