  abstract = {Monitoring and observation over the surface of the Earth have been a matter of global interest. In this path, recent efforts aim to develop a spatial mission to perform remote sensing applications. Mainly, CubeSat nanosatellites have emerged as a standard for developing low-weight and small-sized instruments. In terms of payloads, state-of-the-art optical systems for CubeSats are expensive and designed to work in general use cases. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a 1.4 U compact optical system to acquire spectral images from a CubeSat standard satellite at the height of 550 km. To validate the proposed architecture, optical simulations using ray tracing simulation software are presented. Because the performance of computer vision tasks is highly related to data quality, we compared the optical system in terms of the classification performance on a real remote sensing application. The performances of the optical characterization and land cover classification show that the proposed optical system achieves a compact instrument, operating at a spectral range from 450 nm to 900 nm discretized on 35 spectral bands. The optical system has an overall f-number of 3.41 with a ground sampling distance of 52.8 m and a swath of 40 km. Additionally, the design parameters for each optical element are publicly available for validation, repeatability, and reproducibility of the results.},

abstract = {Phase retrieval (PR) arises from the lack of phase information in the measures recorded by optical sensors. Phase masks that modulate the optical field and reduce ambiguities in the PR problem by producing redundancy in coded diffraction patterns (CDPs) have been included in these diffractive optical systems. Several algorithms have been developed to solve the PR problem from CDPs. Also, deep neural networks (DNNs) are used for solving inverse problems in computational imaging by considering physical constraints in propagation models. However, traditional algorithms based on non-convex formulation include an initialization stage that requires a high number of iterations to properly estimate the optical field. This work proposes an end-to-end (E2E) approach for addressing the PR problem, which jointly learns the spectral initialization and network parameters. Mainly, the proposed deep network approach contains an optical layer that simulates the propagation model in diffractive optical systems, an initialization layer that approximates the underlying optical field from CDPs, and a double branch DNN that improves the obtained initial guess by separately recovering phase and amplitude information. Simulation results show that the proposed E2E approach for PR requires fewer snapshots and iterations than the state of the art.},
